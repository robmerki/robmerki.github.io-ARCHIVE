	<h2>Business</h2>
	<p>I have been captivated by business since I was a young child. Only a few weeks after being admitted into the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia in 2011, I knew I had found the right path. I realized that business isn't a complicated machine, business is just the cooperation of people towards a common goal.</p>
	<p><q>A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business. <br><span> — Henry Ford</span></q></p>
	<p>Businesses such as Apple and Tesla Motors inspire me because of their extreme focus on creating amazing products and experiences for their customers. Product development and design are the most interesting part of business for me.</p>

<section class="fullwidth" id="technology">
	<h2>Technology</h2>
	<p>In 2012 I chose Business Technology Management as my university major. My decision was based on my passion for technology and business that I had developed throughout my youth.</p>
	<p><q>If you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic.<br><span>– Elon Musk</span></q></p>
	<p>Technology is the greatest accomplishment of humankind. Society is already intertwined with the power of computers, and this will only grow as we learn to use it more and more to our advantage.</p>
	<p>Although my main focus is still on the business side of technology, I have had tremendous experience with web design & development (I made this website from scratch), media production, and project management (including GitHub). I have also had experience using enterprise level technologies, such as Tableau and SAP GUI.</p>
	<p>I plan on continuing my career with technology and hope to work within the realm of product design and management in the future.</p>

<section class="fullwidth" id="design">
	<h2>Design</h2>
	<p>As a young child, I was always fascinated by the internet. In a short time, I learned that I could create my very own websites with the same interface that I viewed them: my personal computer. Soon, I dove head first into web design and it has been both a hobby and a job for me since high school.</p>
	<p><q>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.<br><span>– Steve Jobs</span></q></p>
	<p>As I entered university, I quickly realized that there was a great difference between designing nice looking things and designing useful things. Like Steve Jobs said, design is more than just how it looks. Thus the synergy of aesthetics and usability is the crucible of amazing design, which is what I strive for with every project I am a part of.</p>

	<h2>Work and Projects</h2>
	<p>I have been involved with many projects and organizations over the past few years. Here are my most notable experiences that I wish to highlight:</p>
